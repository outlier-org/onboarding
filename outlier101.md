- **Proctorio**: Service and browser plugin used to proctor students during exams.
- **Segment**: Collects student data, then formats and sends it on to a huge range of integrated tools (ActiveCampaign, Amplitude and BigQuery etc) for analytics, marketing, and data warehousing. Rather than setting up API separately for each resource, we simply integrate once with Segment, and then connect to the tools of our choice.

- **GCS (Google Cloud Storage)**: Object storage that’s capable of storing files containing JSON objects as well as static files. In our system we use GCS for storing old progress objects for students who have finished their cohorts so that their data doesn’t need to be frequently accessed or updated. We use it as well for storing text files (i.e pdf, docx, etc.) for students assignments submissions.
- **Shopify**: The store where students can purchase courses/cohort tokens used to enroll
